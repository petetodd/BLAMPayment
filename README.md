## Subscription management
Present users with a customised set of subscription options, highlight the current subscription and/or select a new subscription or cancel an existing subscription.  Present with either a single Subscribe button or Apple Pay and Other buttons.

Button taps trigger delegate protocols which send the details of the selected Subscription.

The included demo app provides a basic example.
